# RateCalculator
Emprevo Coding Test

Write a rate calculation engine for a carpark, the inputs for this engine are:

1. Patron’s Entry Date and Time

2. Patron’s Exit Date and Time

Based on these 2 inputs the engine program should calculate the correct rate for the patron and display the name of

the rate along with the total price to the patron using the following rates:

Name of the Rate Early Bird

Type Flat Rate

Total Price $13.00

Entry condition Enter between 6:00 AM to 9:00 AM

Exit condition Exit between 3:30 PM to 11:30 PM

Name of the Rate Night Rate

Type Flat Rate

Total Price $6.50

Entry condition Enter between 6:00 PM to midnight (weekdays)

Exit condition Exit before 6 AM the following day

Name of the Rate Weekend Rate

Type Flat Rate

Total Price $10.00

Entry condition Enter anytime past midnight on Friday to Sunday

Exit condition Exit any time before midnight of Sunday

Note: If a patron enters the carpark before midnight on Friday and if they qualify

for Night rate on a Saturday morning, then the program should charge the

night rate instead of weekend rate.

For any other entry and exit times the program should refer the following table for calculating the total price.

Name of the Rate Standard Rate

Type Hourly Rate

0 – 1 hours $5.00

1 – 2 hours $10.00

2 – 3 hours $15.00

3 + hours $20.00 flat rate per day for each day of parking.

This test gives you the opportunity to demonstrate your flair for technology and your programming style in C#. The

choice of whether to implement UI or create it as a console app is up to the candidate’s discretion, although unit

testing would be viewed favourably.
